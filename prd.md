# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Title:
**Bridge** – Connecting Generations

---

## Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop a mobile and web-based application that fosters meaningful connections between older adults (aged 60+) and younger individuals (aged 18–35) through conversation, shared activities, and mentorship. The app aims to reduce social isolation, promote intergenerational learning, and enhance well-being.

## Problem Statement

Older adults often face loneliness and social isolation, leading to poor mental and physical health. At the same time, younger people seek mentorship, purpose-driven engagement, and deeper social connections. There is a need for a structured platform that facilitates safe, enriching intergenerational relationships.

- Ensure safety and privacy for all users.

**Success Metrics:**
- >80% monthly retention rate for both user groups.
- >60% of users report reduced feelings of loneliness within 3 months.
- >70% satisfaction rate in feedback surveys.
- Average of 3+ meaningful interactions per week per active user.
